# Recursion
Here we talk about recursion like
<br>🔁 Tower of Hanoi
<br>📐 nCr (with/without recursion & formula)
<br>🐇 Fibonacci (loop & recursion, optimized)
<br>✳️ Factorial & sum of natural numbers
<br>📊 Taylor series (simple & Horner’s rule)
<br>🌳 Tree, nested & indirect recursion
<br>📌 Static & global variables
<br>🔄 Calling vs returning recursion
